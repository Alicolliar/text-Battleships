# Text Based Battleships
## This, is text based Battleships
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/Alicolliar/text-Battleships)](https://repl.it/github/Alicolliar/text-Battleships)

## Premise
If you've ever played the game "Battleships" before, then this is like that, but worse

much, much worse.

## Installation
Simply copy the code, type `python3 battleships.py`

# Or
There is no need to install the code if you go to [repl.it](https://text-Battleships.alicolliar.repl.run) and run the program from there.

## How to play
This should become fairly apparent as the game should prompt you at times on how to play it. If you are unaware of anything concerning Battleships, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_%28game%29#History).

## Roadmap
What I plan to do next:
- [x] Implement the boat selection for both humans and AI
- [ ] Implement the turn mechanism for both humans and AI
- [ ] Implement an optional Salvo mode
- [ ] *Maybe* implement some kind of pc-pc multiplayer system
